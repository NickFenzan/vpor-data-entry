<h2>The story so far...</h2>
<p>
    This little section of the EMR will help us enter data into a website that 
    can submit information to the government on our behalf. Submitting this 
    information to the government requires special accreditation, so we 
    can't submit the information without a third-party. By getting all of this 
    information in before the end of the year, Miller Vein avoids a 2% penalty 
    on all Medicare claims in 2017. We would have liked to start entering data 
    earlier or automatically, but finding a website that could submit 
    information for such a specialized practice was challenging. If we all pitch
    in where we can we should be able to get it done. Next year, Athena will be
    taking care of this for us.
</p>
<h2>Here's what we need to do</h2>
<p>
    You are going to have two windows up for this process: this one and 
    <a href='http://venouspatientregistry.org/' target='_blank'>
        http://venouspatientregistry.org/
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    Right now we have four sets of credentials. They cannot be used by multiple
    people at the same time. This means that if one tells you it is already 
    signed in somewhere, try another. The usernames are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>jhmiller</li>
    <li>skwang</li>
    <li>mlulenski</li>
    <li>nickf</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The password for all of them should be <em>PQRS12345!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Once you are in here are the steps you need to take. Steps that start with 
    <strong>EMR</strong> should be done in this window. Steps that start with 
    <strong>VPOR</strong> should be done in the other window.
