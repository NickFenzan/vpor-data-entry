<h2>The story so far...</h2>
<p>
    Everyone did a great job with part 1! We entered all of the patient 
    demographic information we had in our system for 2015! However, we still 
    need to add our follow-ups and procedures, as well as any new patient 
    demographics that may pop up.
</p>
<h2>Here's what we need to do</h2>
<p>
    You are going to have two windows up for this process: this one and 
    <a href='http://venouspatientregistry.org/' target='_blank'>
        http://venouspatientregistry.org/
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    We have four sets of credentials. They cannot be used by multiple
    people at the same time. This means that if one tells you it is already 
    signed in somewhere, try another. The usernames are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>jhmiller</li>
    <li>skwang</li>
    <li>mlulenski</li>
    <li>nickf</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The password for all of them should be <em>PQRS12345!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Once you are in here are the steps you need to take. Steps that start with 
    <strong>EMR</strong> should be done in this window. Steps that start with 
    <strong>VPOR</strong> should be done in the other window.
